Portfolio Reflection – DriverPass Project
The DriverPass project focused on designing a web-based system for a driving education company that wanted to help students prepare for their driving tests. The client needed a system that allowed users to register, schedule lessons, take online practice exams, and track 
their progress. The goal was to create an efficient and secure system that streamlined the learning process while improving communication between students and instructors.

I did particularly well on the system diagrams and documentation. My UML activity and class diagrams clearly showed how different components interact, and I made sure each diagram aligned with the client’s needs. If I were to revise one part of my work, I would improve the 
use case diagram by adding more detail about how instructors interact with scheduling and lesson management to better show the full system scope.

To meet the user’s needs, I translated business requirements into clear technical elements such as authentication, scheduling, and reporting features. Understanding and incorporating user needs is essential to ensure the final product is both useful and user-friendly. When 
designing software, I focus on gathering complete requirements early and maintaining flexibility as the design evolves. In future projects, I plan to continue using UML diagrams and user feedback to guide my analysis and design process for better clarity and collaboration.
